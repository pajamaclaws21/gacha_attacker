<p><em>tiny message from pj</em></p>
<p>woo, I have a website for this, and (soon) an executable... i never thought i'd get this far on a game i made.
	gacha_attacker is a little game I made with Snap<em>!</em> (a block-based coding language). and this game, well,
	it's a labor of love! i've worked on it for many weeks, and i'm very happy with it. so yeah. hope you enjoy ;')</p>

<h3>the official home site of gacha_attacker</h3>
<p>As you can read from the title, this is the official home site of my game, gacha_attacker. It has basic info, and a
	game link and download. It's pretty cool, I think! Despite it being so cool, there's a bit of reading you need to do
	before playing the game. Let's do that first!</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/tors.html">tutorial & summary</a>
	<li><a href="/gachs.html">gacha & stuff</a>
</ul>
<p>Okay, cool. Once you've read those, you might find it helpful to check out <a href="/upda.html">the updates page</a>, which
	contains general information about updates to the game.</p>
