<h3>basic summary and stuff</h3>
<p>
In gacha_attacker, you defeat enemies and get new characters. To defeat enemies, you launch bullets by pressing SPACE.
When an enemy’s health is 0, it’s dead, and you get a point!
<br><br>
You can spend these points in GACHA to get new characters. Press GACHA to open the GACHA menu, when it’s unlocked! Each
character has new powers, and a different rarity (3-5, 5 being the rarest). When you get a character multiple times, it
gets BOOSTed! The character gets new powers each time it’s BOOSTed.
